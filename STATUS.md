# Status 2026-05-31 — eleven capture wedges (keysym, WM-property, visual catalog, Tier-4 extensions, resource registry, Motif properties, type-fallback, ClientMessage payload, WM_COMMAND argv, reply-body batch 1, reply-tail) + console quieted

Two small landings on a Sun-less day. Both pure capture-side, no live
verification needed.

**`macxserver` console quieted.** Per-session and bridge traces are now
disk-only at `/tmp/macxserver/<instance>-<ts>.log` by default. New
`--verbose` / `-v` flag restores stderr mirroring when debugging. Listener
events (accept errors, shutdown) keep their stderr sink — those are rare
and worth seeing. `09bf07e`.

**Keysym + modifier symbolic decode for the capture viewer.** First wedge
out of the macXcapture decoder push's Phase 4-5 work, picked as the
highest-payoff Sun-independent gap from the checklist's vintage-lens top 5.

Three pieces:

- 1224-entry keysym name table generated from
  `reference/X11R6/xc/include/keysymdef.h` into
  `Sources/SwiftXCaptureCore/Keysyms.generated.swift`. Regen script at
  `Tools/regen_keysyms.sh`. Public API `keysymName(_:)` +
  `modifierMaskString(_:)` + `grabModifierString(_:)` in `Keysyms.swift`.
- `ChronoContext` now tracks a session keymap, populated from
  `GetKeyboardMapping` replies and `ChangeKeyboardMapping` requests.
  `KeyPress`/`KeyRelease` events translate keycode → keysym for output;
  before the keymap is populated, falls back to bare keycode.
- 7 dumper call sites rewritten: `GrabButton`, `GrabKey`, `UngrabButton`,
  `UngrabKey`, the four input-event types (state field), and
  `ChangeKeyboardMapping` payload (now prints rows as
  `kc7=[Tab,ISO_Left_Tab] kc8=[Return]`, capped to 8 keycodes + ellipsis).

Verified against `captures/xterm-running-on-ss2-display-on-ss2.xtap` —
live key trace now reads as `KeyPress L (keycode=92) state=none` and
`KeyPress X (keycode=108) state=Ctrl` instead of the prior
`keycode/btn=92 state=0x0` / `keycode/btn=108 state=0x4`. 12 new unit
tests; 1083/1083 total tests pass.

Checklist (`macXcapture-feature-checklist.md`): two §3 rows moved No → Yes
(keysym decode, modifier mask decode). Counts: 24/35/67/1 → 26/35/65/1.
Vintage-lens gap #1 closed.

**WM-property type-aware decode (vintage-lens gap #2).** Second wedge of
the day, same pattern. The five ICCCM WM_* properties plus WM_TRANSIENT_FOR
now decode inline on both the `ChangeProperty` request and `GetProperty`
reply paths:

- WM_NORMAL_HINTS — flags list + populated size/min/max/inc/aspect/base/
  gravity fields (gravity rendered by name).
- WM_HINTS — flag list, input bool, initialState name, icon refs, urgency.
- WM_STATE — state name, icon window.
- WM_CLASS — instance/class strings split from the NUL-terminated pair.
- WM_PROTOCOLS — atom-name list resolved through `ctx.atomToName`.
- WM_TRANSIENT_FOR — single window id.
- Fallback: generic `ATOM`-typed properties get the atom-list renderer
  even when the property name isn't in the WM_* set.

Layouts in `Sources/SwiftXCaptureCore/WMProperties.swift`, ported from
`reference/libX11/src/Xatomtype.h` and ICCCM §4. `ChronoContext` gained
`seqToGetPropertyAtom` for request → reply pairing. New
`previewBytesRaw(_:format:)` overload lets the reply path call the
generic preview without an enum round-trip.

Verified against the corpus: `xterm` capture shows
`prop=WM_NORMAL_HINTS ... flags=PSize|PWinGravity PSize=484x316
gravity=NorthWest` and `prop=WM_HINTS ... flags=Input|State input=true
initialState=Normal`; `xedit` shows `prop=WM_PROTOCOLS ... type=ATOM
... atoms=[WM_DELETE_WINDOW]`. 15 new unit tests; 1098/1098 total tests
pass.

Checklist §3 "Property values decoded with type awareness" row stays
Partial (WM_* done; CARDINAL and non-WM_* STRING decoding still
fall through to `previewBytes`). Vintage-lens gap #2 marked Closed.

**Visual catalog lookup (vintage-lens gap #3).** Third wedge of the day,
same pattern again. `ChronoContext.visualCatalog` is populated at the
SetupAccepted landing by walking every screen → allowedDepths → visuals
tuple; entries record depth + class + bitsPerRgbValue + screen index.
`visualDisplay(_:ctx:)` renders a visualId as `0x22(PseudoColor d8)`,
falling back to bare hex when the catalog hasn't been populated. The
spec sentinels for `CreateWindow.visual=0` and `CreateWindow.depth=0`
render as `CopyFromParent` by name.

Two dumper sites rewired: CreateWindow gained explicit `depth=` and
`visual=` fields (previously only the class field was printed);
CreateColormap's visual now resolves through the new helper instead of
the old `windowDisplay` shorthand.

Verified against the corpus: ico, auto-box, and xmag captures now show
`visual=0x22(PseudoColor d8)` where before they showed bare hex; xterm
still reads `visual=CopyFromParent` because xterm inherits its parent's
visual rather than picking one explicitly. 5 new unit tests; 1103/1103
total tests pass.

Checklist row §3 "Visual and depth references resolved" moved No → Yes
(27/35/64/1). Vintage-lens gap #3 marked Closed.

**XC-MISC / XTEST / RECORD extension decoders (vintage-lens gap #4).**
Fourth wedge of the day. Three new `ExtensionDumper` implementations
registered in `ExtensionDumperRegistry.builtins`:

- `XcMiscDumper` — three requests (GetVersion, GetXIDRange, GetXIDList).
  Layouts from `reference/X11R6/xc/include/extensions/xcmiscstr.h`.
- `XTestDumper` — four requests (GetVersion, CompareCursor, FakeInput,
  GrabControl). FakeInput is the meaty one — synthesized input event:
  the `detail` field is labeled per `type` (keycode for Key*,
  button for Button*, absolute/relative for MotionNotify). Layouts from
  `reference/xproto/include/X11/extensions/xtestproto.h`.
- `RecordDumper` — all eight context-management requests. Trailing
  variable-length CLIENTSPEC and RECORDRANGE lists surface as counts
  only; per-element walks deferred. Layouts from
  `/opt/X11/include/X11/extensions/recordproto.h`.

No corpus capture exercises any of these (they're for external
captures: input-injection rigs, macro-recording tools, long-running
sessions that exhaust the resource-id pool). Verified via 15 new unit
tests in `Tier4ExtensionTests.swift` — both byte orders, every minor
opcode shape covered. 1118/1118 total tests pass.

Checklist §4: XC-MISC + XTEST + RECORD all No → Yes. Counts:
27/35/64/1 → 30/35/61/1. Vintage-lens gap #4 marked Closed.

**Resource registry / lineage (vintage-lens gap #5).** Fifth wedge of
the day. The architectural one. `ResourceRegistry` is a public
session-wide registry keyed by resource id, tracking creation +
free-time for all six X11 resource kinds (window, pixmap, GC, font,
cursor, colormap). Populated in `dump()`'s request-dispatch loop via
`trackResourceLifecycle(_:seq:registry:)` — every Create* / Free* shape
maps cleanly. ID reuse honored: new creation overwrites the slot but
separate monotonic counters keep session-end stats honest.

Two consumer features ship in the same wedge:

1. **Session-end resource summary landmark.** After the existing
   `# Session ends after Xs (N requests, M events)` line, a new
   `# resources: 2 windows (0 freed, 2 leaked), 7 GCs (1 freed, 6 leaked),
   4 fonts (0 freed, 4 leaked), 8 cursors (0 freed, 8 leaked)` line
   surfaces every kind with non-zero activity. Vintage clients commonly
   "leak" all resources at shutdown (server cleans up on disconnect),
   so the leak counts are diagnostic, not accusatory.

2. **Use-after-free / lineage annotation on XError landmarks.**
   `LandmarkDetector.errorLandmark` now consults the registry. When the
   bad resource id was created earlier in the session, the landmark
   gets a `(created at seq=X)` suffix. When it was created AND freed
   before the failing request, the suffix becomes
   `(freed at seq=Y, created at seq=X)` — the textbook use-after-free
   signal, surfaced automatically.

LandmarkDetector keeps its window-specific state (top-level identity,
transient-for, click resolution) since that's a different concern than
raw lineage; the two are complementary now.

Verified against the xterm and xedit corpus captures — both produce a
clean `# resources:` line at end-of-session. Use-after-free path
covered by synthetic unit tests (no corpus capture happens to trigger
it). 12 new tests in `ResourceRegistryTests.swift`; 1130/1130 total
tests pass.

Checklist §3 "Resource IDs tracked" Partial → Yes; §3 "Resource
creation lineage shown" No → Yes; §3 "Resource lifetime tracked" No →
Yes; §6 "Resource leak detection" No → Partial (session-end count
lands, per-resource detail still missing); §6 "Use-after-free detection"
No → Yes. Counts: 30/35/61/1 → 34/35/57/1. Vintage-lens gap #5 Closed.

**All five top-5 vintage-lens readability gaps closed in one Sun-less
day.** Plus the console-quiet server wedge from this morning.

**Bonus: `_MOTIF_*` property decoders.** With the top-5 closed, picked
the highest-leverage *purely vintage* follow-up: four Motif-specific
property decoders that no modern audience cares about but every vintage
CDE/Motif client sets at realize time. Wired into the existing
`decodeKnownWMProperty` dispatcher in `WMProperties.swift`:

- `_MOTIF_WM_HINTS` — flags + functions + decorations + inputMode +
  status. Layout from `reference/motif/lib/Xm/MwmUtil.h`
  `PropMotifWmHints`. The mwm/dtwm communication channel; every Motif
  top-level uses it.
- `_MOTIF_WM_INFO` — mwm-startup flags + wmWindow id. Layout same
  header. Published by the running window manager on the root.
- `_MOTIF_DRAG_WINDOW` — single WINDOW id, the DnD root-window proxy.
  Reuses the existing `decodeSingleWindow` path.
- `_MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO` — 16-byte header for a drop target.
  Layout from `reference/motif/lib/Xm/DragICCI.h`
  `xmDragReceiverInfoStruct`. Has an embedded `byte_order` byte ('l'/
  'B') that overrides the X11 connection's endianness — Motif's DnD
  properties are self-describing so any client can read them
  regardless of its own byte order. Decoder honors this.

Plus the `_MWM_*` alias variants (`_MWM_HINTS`, `_MWM_INFO`) — the
Motif source uses both spellings interchangeably.

Verified against the corpus: dogs/motifanim/fileview etc. now render
`prop=_MOTIF_DRAG_WINDOW ... window=0x2400001` (proxy resolution),
`prop=_MOTIF_WM_HINTS ... flags=INPUT_MODE inputMode=MODELESS`
(non-modal dialog), `prop=_MOTIF_DRAG_RECEIVER_INFO ... endian=msb
protocol=0 style=PREFER_PREREGISTER proxy=None sites=2 heap=72`
(fileview as a 2-site drop target). 11 new unit tests; 1141/1141 total
tests pass. No checklist count shifts — the type-aware row was already
Partial and this extends its coverage without flipping it.

**Type-driven property decode fallback.** Seventh wedge — closes the
§3 "type-aware decoding" row from Partial → Yes. The dispatcher in
`WMProperties.swift` gained a `decodePropertyByType` fallback that
fires whenever the property name didn't match a WM_* / _MOTIF_* case:

- **CARDINAL** / **INTEGER**: render as decimal lists (unsigned /
  signed). Format-width-aware: 8/16/32 bits. Truncated to 8 elements
  with `…(+N)` tail.
- **STRING** / **UTF8_STRING** / **COMPOUND_TEXT**: render as quoted
  text up to 200 chars (Latin-1 for STRING/COMPOUND_TEXT, UTF-8 for
  UTF8_STRING). Newlines/CR/tab escaped; control bytes → `?`; longer
  bodies show `…" (N bytes)` suffix.
- **WINDOW** / **PIXMAP** / **COLORMAP** / **CURSOR** / **FONT** /
  **DRAWABLE**: render as resource-id lists with `None` for id=0.
- **ATOM**: already covered by `decodeAtomList`.

Verified against the corpus: `RESOURCE_MANAGER` now reads as
`value="! Reserved for resources that should apply...\n"` (truncated
preview of the actual Xrm text) instead of `data=30567b`;
`_MOTIF_DEFAULT_BINDINGS` shows its osfKey binding list inline;
`WM_CLIENT_MACHINE` resolves to the hostname string.

One stale test in WMPropertyTests had to be updated — its
"unknown-property returns nil" assumption no longer holds when the
type is recognized. Replaced with a positive test for the new path.
15 new unit tests; 1157/1157 total tests pass. Checklist §3 row
Partial → Yes: 34/35/57/1 → 35/34/57/1.

**ClientMessage payload decode.** Eighth wedge. The wire-level decoder
for ClientMessage was already in place (type atom + window + 20-byte
payload), but the payload bytes were opaque. Now decoded by type:

- `WM_PROTOCOLS` (format=32): `protocol=WM_DELETE_WINDOW time=12345`
  / `protocol=WM_TAKE_FOCUS time=CurrentTime`. The close-window / focus
  handshake every Motif/CDE client uses. Resolves the protocol atom via
  `ctx.atomToName` + predefined atoms; `time=0` → `CurrentTime`.
- `_MOTIF_WM_MESSAGES` (format=32): renders the message code as a
  named MWM_F_FUNCTION_* function id (24 values from MwmUtil.h), plus
  timestamp + first argument word.
- Generic fallback: format=32 → 5 CARD32 hex list; format=16 → 10
  CARD16; format=8 → 20 bytes as hex tuples.

No corpus capture exercises a resolved-type ClientMessage today —
captures are short and rarely include close-window flows — so verified
via 10 unit tests covering all branches plus the no-atom + unresolved
cases. 1167/1167 total tests pass. Checklist counts unchanged (this
wedge enriches the already-Yes "core events decoded" row rather than
flipping anything).

**WM_COMMAND argv decode.** Ninth wedge. ICCCM §4.1.2.7 spec'd as a
STRING property where each argv element is a NUL-terminated 8-bit
string laid out back-to-back; libX11's `XSetCommand` emits
`arg0\0arg1\0...argN\0`. Named-property dispatcher now splits on NUL
and renders as `argv=["xterm", "-bg", "black", "-fg", "cyan", "-e",
"ls"]`. Forgiving on a missing trailing NUL — surfaces the final
fragment rather than dropping it. Non-printable bytes become `?` so a
weird byte doesn't break the line.

No corpus capture sets WM_COMMAND (vintage clients commonly set it
via XSetStandardProperties early in main(), but our short captures
catch shortly after the connection setup and most clients we have
captured don't call SSP). Decoder is unit-tested only — 5 new cases:
single arg, multiple args, malformed trailing fragment, empty data,
format=32 rejection.

1172/1172 total tests pass. Doesn't move a checklist row — extends
the named-property dispatcher which is already part of the Yes
type-aware-decoding row.

**Reply-body decode for 10 more opcodes.** Tenth wedge — biggest of
the day by reply lines affected (~3300 in the corpus). Targets the §3
"All core replies decoded — Partial" row. The dumper's reply path
gained dispatch blocks for the ten most-frequent unenriched opcodes,
picked by corpus-wide frequency count:

- `GetInputFocus` (1654 hits): `focus=0x140000E revertTo=parent`
  (`None` / `PointerRoot` sentinels named).
- `GetAtomName` (493 hits): `atom=0x7F → name="-Misc-Fixed-Medium-..."`
  Also populates `ctx.atomToName` in reverse so later atom references
  resolve symbolically.
- `GetGeometry` (295 hits): `root=0x2B at (0,0) 484x316 border=0 depth=8`
- `QueryTree` (143 hits): `root=… parent=… children=[…,…(+N)]`
  (8-element cap with leak-indicator tail).
- `QueryColors` (80 hits): `rgb=[(0,0,0),(255,255,255),…(+N)]`
  (4-triple cap; 8-bit components extracted from the wire's 16-bit
  values).
- `GetModifierMapping` (72 hits): `perMod=2 Shift=[50,62] Ctrl=[37]`
  with empty slots suppressed and Lock/Mod1..5 named.
- `GrabPointer` + `GrabKeyboard` (combined 117 hits): `status=success`
  / `status=frozen` etc.
- `GetSelectionOwner` (58 hits): `owner=0x2800029` / `owner=None`.
- `QueryPointer` (41 hits): root + win coords + child + button mask
  symbolic.
- `TranslateCoordinates` (38 hits): `dst=(621,299) child=0x100051F`.
- `QueryBestSize` (29 hits): `best=32x32`.
- `GetWindowAttributes` (29 hits): class + visual (resolved through
  the catalog) + mapState + override.

Combined with the 7 already-decoded replies (InternAtom,
QueryExtension, QueryFont, AllocColor, AllocNamedColor, GetProperty,
GetKeyboardMapping), the chrono dump now renders rich detail for 17
of 30 reply-producing opcodes. The remaining ~12 (ListFonts,
GetMotionEvents, ListHosts, etc.) are longer-tail / less-common —
deferred without ceremony.

Verified against the corpus: xterm capture now reads
`Reply (GetAtomName) atom=0x7F → name="-Misc-Fixed-Medium-R-Semi
Condensed--13-120-75-75-C-60-ISO8859-1"`; dogs capture
`Reply (QueryTree) root=0x2B parent=None children=[0x2400001,...,
…(+11)]`. 17 new unit tests + bonus end-to-end round-trip through
`formatServerMessage` for every decoder. 1189/1189 total tests pass.

**Reply-tail: the remaining 16 reply decoders.** Eleventh wedge. With
the most-frequent batch covered in the previous commit, this wedge
closes the §3 "All core replies decoded" row — Partial → Yes —
by wiring the rest:

- `ListProperties` — atom list per window, resolved via atom table.
- `ListFonts` — font name list (cap 4 with tail count).
- `ListFontsWithInfo` — per-font metadata with end-of-list marker.
- `GetFontPath` — server's font-search dirs.
- `ListExtensions` — extension catalog.
- `ListInstalledColormaps` — installed cmap stack.
- `ListHosts` — access-control list + enabled flag.
- `GetImage` — depth + visual + pixel-byte count.
- `GetKeyboardControl` — autoRepeat + LED mask + bell params.
- `GetPointerControl` — acceleration ratio + threshold.
- `GetPointerMapping` — button id remap.
- `GetScreenSaver` — timeout + interval + blanking prefs.
- `QueryKeymap` — count of keys currently held down.
- `QueryTextExtents` — overall width + ascent/descent + direction.
- `LookupColor` — exact + visual RGB triples.
- `SetModifierMapping` / `SetPointerMapping` — status enum
  (Success/Busy/Failed).

Verified against the corpus: `Reply (LookupColor) exact=(0,255,255)
visual=(0,255,255)` (cyan), `Reply (GetImage) depth=8 visual=
0x22(PseudoColor d8) bytes=4096`, `Reply (ListProperties) atoms=
[WM_STATE,WM_PROTOCOLS,0x98,…,WM_CLASS,WM_HINTS,WM_NORMAL_HINTS,…(+4)]`.

The only reply-producing opcodes that stay bare are AllocColorCells /
AllocColorPlanes (no framer decoder — rarely-used cmap-allocation
patterns) and GetMotionEvents (framer assumes nEvents=0 by design).
**33 of 33 viable reply-producing opcodes now render rich detail.**

18 new tests via end-to-end round-trip through formatServerMessage
(35 cases in ReplyDecodeTests total now). 1207/1207 total tests pass.

Checklist §3 "All core replies decoded" Partial → Yes:
35/34/57/1 → 36/33/57/1.

Twelve commits, 104 new unit tests, no regressions, no Sun required.

# Status 2026-05-30 — three-day rollup (SHAPE; capture v2 GUI; macXcapture decoder push)

Three days of major work landed since the 2026-05-27 entry below. Writing
this as a single rollup because no end-of-day STATUS pass got made on
05-28, 05-29, or 05-30 -- the work was real, the doc just slipped. A new
Stop hook landed today to nag when this happens again.

## 2026-05-28 -- SHAPE extension

oclock comes up round and xeyes as a bare oval. SHAPE shipped as major
opcode 128, event base 64, no extension-specific errors. All 9 requests
implemented and the region state is stored/queryable; visual application
covers the bounding shape on a top-level (the demoable win). Clip shape
and descendant-window shape are stored but not yet applied to rendering
-- ledgered in SHORTCUTS with the exit plan. See DECISIONS 2026-05-28
for the scope decision and `reference_xeyes_round_without_shape` memory
for the corrected note (the earlier memory claiming xeyes never used
SHAPE was wrong; Xmu calls `XShapeCombineMask`).

Three commits trace the arc:

- `5be5334` -- core: protocol + region engine + storage. Region algebra
  is a faithful port of `Xext/shape.c:RegionOperate` onto our existing
  `Region`. ShapeMask's bitmap-to-region reuses the depth-1 fully-black
  convention from the FillStippled reader. Real xcalc and xeyes SS2
  captures now replay their SHAPE traffic with zero XErrors.
- `6a03159` -- render path: bounding-shaped top-levels actually appear
  shaped on screen. Three things had to align: map-time re-apply (oclock
  shapes before mapping, but our NSWindow/view is created lazily at
  map, so the original ShapeMask landed against a nil view and was
  dropped); transparency (FlippedXView clears its backing + the layer
  background to clear, NSWindow goes non-opaque); and edge quality (the
  protocol region is 1-logical-pixel banded, which our display scale
  magnifies into visible stair-steps -- ShapeMask now also captures a
  device-resolution mask from the source pixmap while it's still alive,
  and the clip follows that at full backing resolution).
- `6496b6f` -- Motif-frame integration: when the local mwm-look frame
  is on, a shaped client renders mwm-style (rectangular title bar OR'ed
  with the client shape, per mwm's `SetFrameShape`). `MotifFrameView`
  gains a `clientIsShaped` flag that reports `isOpaque=false` and draws
  only the title-bar strip while transparent everywhere else.

Also that day: remote launcher learned TERM=xterm telnet negotiation
(`2db4596`) so `.cshrc` prompt setup runs on the remote, and
`LaunchProgressWindowController` got Xcode-target-registered
(`7b4c01c`).

## 2026-05-29 -- Capture v2 largely lands + ss2 rebaseline

Capture v2 (the library + GUI app + decoded-text export from
`DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-23) shipped most of its scope in a single push.
macXcapture is now a real Mac app, not a CLI:

- `1294bc0` -- optional decoded `.txt` log alongside each `.xtap`,
  written as the capture runs.
- `6485f7d` -- capture viewer window with standardized chrono dump
  formatting. Opens any `.xtap` file in a syntax-highlighted code-editor
  view.
- `66f6b4d` -- moved `.txt` generation out of the capture path and into
  the viewer as Save As / Export as Text. Captures stay binary; the
  viewer renders to text on demand.
- `d95a66b` -- extracted shared `SwiftXCaptureUI`. The capture app and
  the server's debug viewer now use the same code path.
- `550a8aa` -- Record screen redesigned as a stacked 6-step wizard:
  source / target / proxy / output / launcher / go.
- `ce28a32` -- launcher gained an optional plaintext password field
  with keychain fallback.
- `f5e2301` -- red XTAP app icon, distinct from the blue X server icon
  (`Icons/CaptureAppIcon.appiconset/`). Render script lives in
  `Icons/source/`.

Then the ss2 rebaseline (`c3f1572`): fresh `ss2 -> swiftx` capture pairs
for the dt-apps and quickplot, plus refreshed ss2-only golds. This
moots the "STALE pending u5 recapture" notes on
`project_motif_quickplot_status`, `project_dt_apps_status`, and
`project_dt_apps_theme_pass_open` -- the captures are now in tree.

End of day, the macXcapture mission doc landed (`40dea83`): mission
statement, decoder coverage plan, Phase 0 audit. Establishes the OSS
launch bar (decode any capture with zero `opcode=N (untyped)` lines for
documented opcodes) and the phased plan to get there. PRODUCT_1_CAPTURE
and PROJECT folded the mission in.

## 2026-05-30 -- Decoder coverage Phases 1-3, inline landmark detector, Phase 5 polish

The biggest single-day decoder push since the framer was first written.
Roughly five threads of work:

**Phase 1 -- framer core gaps closed (`672f01d`)**: 16 requests + 6
replies + 5 events that the framer had been silently treating as
untyped. CopyGC, FontPath ops, HostAccess ops, Keyboard ops, Pointer
ops, PropertyList ops, ListProperties/GetFontPath/GetKeyboardControl/
GetPointerControl/ListHosts/SetMapping replies. Round-trip tested.

**Phase 2 -- extension dumper registry (`d95e957`)**: ChronoDumper now
dispatches by negotiated major opcode to per-extension dumpers
registered at startup. Replaces the hardcoded shape-dumper bolt-on.
`ShapeDumper` lifts to the new registry.

**Phase 3 -- extension decoders, three sessions per extension**:

- BIG-REQUESTS + MIT-SHM (`37a2c8d`).
- XKB Sessions 1-3 (`df89a00`, `5cfeb72`, `72c878a`) -- Tier A
  requests + all 11 events; `GetMap`/`SetMap` nested-list trailer;
  Tier B/C bulk.
- XInput v1 Sessions 1-2 (`71739e4`, `a31b5e9`) -- Tier A + class
  trailer + events; Tier B/C bulk + three union types.
- RENDER Sessions 1-3 (`e3721bf`, `ea82093`, `820c11b`) -- Tier A +
  PictFormats walker; glyph stack + filter/index queries; Tier B/C
  bulk.

OPCODE_STATUS was updated in lockstep on every commit.

**Phase 5 polish**: visual request/reply pairing via a `↳` glyph
(`9664a68`) and a `↙` glyph for replies (`9417165`); field-level
semantic diff in CaptureDiff (`f6c19ef`); proxy read/write paths
harmonized with the listener (`218dc53` -- EINTR/EAGAIN retry +
errno logging).

**Inline narrative landmark detector** -- new sub-feature that landed
in four phases:

- `9111f86` -- core: LandmarkDetector + syntax-colored `# ...` callouts
  inline in the dump. Server-side parity in `ServerSession`.
- `af25b2f` / `230b4d2` -- rewrote landmarks as story-form narration,
  left-justified `# ...` comments. Fixed the first-top-level
  detection bug.
- `9417165` -- verbose identify landmarks (which app each window came
  from).
- `b5a233d` / `de4160d` / `16fd018` / `7796097` -- Phases A through D:
  window hierarchy + click contextualization; hidden / closed /
  dialog-dismissed landmarks; error correlation + session-end summary;
  viewer-side landmark navigation (sidebar + Cmd-]/Cmd-[).

**Docs + ledger**:

- `201c52c` / `d3d43ec` -- macXcapture feature checklist created and
  filled (22 Yes / 34 Partial / 69 No / 1 N/A).
- `2f912fc` -- checklist rewrapped + vintage-X11-lens synopsis added.
- `532e786` -- end-of-day audit against the day's landmark + diff
  work. Four row moves; checklist now 24/35/67/1 (127 items, +2 Yes,
  +1 Partial, -3 No net).
- `60568bb` -- xcodegen regen to pick up Phase 1-3 source files.
- `ff7dd8c` -- server: drop the session-end console summary that the
  capture-side landmark sweep made redundant.
- `ac2614c` -- server: close landmark parity with the capture side.
- `9eacc8a` -- new memory: don't filter protocol truth from output
  (`feedback_dont_filter_protocol_truth`). Rephrase quirky-but-real
  wire acts (empty WM_NAME, hidden helper windows) so they read
  cleanly instead of hiding them.

## What's open

Carrying over from prior status entries, no progress since 2026-05-27
on:

- Framer-shared bug investigation (carried since 05-19).
- dtpad Gap B: text-area paint loss on resize (DECISIONS 2026-05-25
  flagged as separate from the preservation work).
- dtpad menu-bar erase on dialog popup (DECISIONS 2026-05-25).
- Horizontal scrollbar reverse-image rendering (DECISIONS 2026-05-25).

New since the SHAPE work:

- Clip-shape and descendant-window shape: stored but not rendered. No
  hosted client needs them today. See SHORTCUTS for the exit plan.
- ShapeNotify is per-session, not cross-session (SHORTCUTS).
- `ShapeRectangles` ordering claim not enforced (SHORTCUTS, low value).

New since the macXcapture push:

- The 67 `No` rows in `macXcapture-feature-checklist.md`. Phase 4-5
  of the decoder coverage plan is the next focused push if we want
  to keep moving on OSS-launch quality.

# Status 2026-05-27 — remote launcher; Motif clipboard; root properties; configurable frame; doc audit

Started as cleanup, turned into the biggest feature day of the project.

**Remote app launcher.** New Launchers submenu in the app menu. Each
entry telnets to a vintage Sun, logs in, sets DISPLAY, launches the
X app in background, disconnects. Config file `~/.swiftx-launchers`
(INI format, same editor pattern as fonts/resources). Passwords in
macOS Keychain. Configurable prompt patterns for non-standard shells
(`login_prompt`, `password_prompt`, `shell_prompt`). Optional verbose
flag shows a progress window with the telnet session log -- typed text
in bold, echo suppressed at the byte level, ANSI escapes stripped.
Telnet IAC negotiation handles SunOS 4.1.4 through Solaris 2.6.
Tested live against u5. Nine new files, ~1100 lines.

**Motif frame chrome now configurable.** `MotifTheme` converted from
static constants to a loaded struct driven by `[motif-frame]` section
in `~/.swiftx-resources`. Colors (hex or X11 named), bevel width,
frame width, title bar height, button style all editable. Existing
installs get the section auto-appended on first startup.

**Root-window properties moved to ServerCoordinator.** The oldest
architectural bug in the server: root-window properties were per-session
(PropertyTable on ServerSession), so anything one client wrote to root
was invisible to another client. Fixed by adding a server-global
PropertyTable on ServerCoordinator with NSLock guarding, a
RootPropertyObserver protocol for PropertyNotify fan-out across
sessions, and routing all ChangeProperty/GetProperty/DeleteProperty
on root through the coordinator. Session-init properties
(_MOTIF_DRAG_WINDOW, _MOTIF_WM_INFO, RESOURCE_MANAGER) also moved.

**Motif clipboard copy/paste between apps now works.** The unlock.
Motif's CutPaste.c stores all clipboard state as root-window properties
(_MOTIF_CLIP_HEADER, _MOTIF_CLIP_LOCK, _MOTIF_CLIP_ITEM_*, etc.) and
uses a PropertyNotify-on-root timestamp probe (ClipboardGetCurrentTime)
that blocked forever because we never emitted PropertyNotify for root.
Two fixes: (1) emitPropertyNotify now checks rootEventMask for root
windows (was only checking WindowEntry, which doesn't exist for root);
(2) the root property migration above makes clipboard data visible
across sessions. Verified: two dtpads from u5, Copy in one, Paste in
the other transfers text correctly.

**Pixmap-writer y-flip verified live.** quickplot button-bar icons
right-side-up, horizontal scrollbar thumb shadow correct orientation.
Closes the 2026-05-27 morning investigation.

**Doc audit sweep.** Went through all docs and compiled a 26-item open
bug list. Todd verified 4 items are already fixed (resize repaint gap,
small gray rectangles, dtpad menu-bar erase, window placement). Agent
audit of the remaining 22 found 2 more already fixed in code (NoExpose
gating on graphicsExposures, SetupAccepted display-adaptive) and one
stale count (cursor glyph mapping is 22 values not ~10). All docs
updated.

Previous status entry (morning) preserved below.

# Status 2026-05-27 (morning) — dt-app theme dead-rule sweep; pixmap-writer y-flip closed

Cleanup session. Two commits, both pushed.

**Retired dead dt-app dialog-button foreground rules (`9aa90c3`).** Spent
the afternoon debugging dtpad's `save_warn` dialog buttons — none of our
`Dtpad*save_warn*…foreground` rules took, no matter the binding
tightness. Kitchen-sink diagnostic at every level from `*OK.foreground`
up to the fully-tight `Dtpad.save_warn_popup.save_warn.OK.foreground`
all failed to land. A paired `background:MidnightBlue` test also didn't
move. But shape rules (`shadowThickness:8`, `marginWidth:20`,
`marginHeight:15`) DID land and visibly bloomed the buttons. That's the
mechanism evidence: Motif sets dialog-button fg/bg programmatically via
`XmGetColors()` at widget-create time (`XtSetArg` under the hood),
which beats every Xrm rule we can write. Shape rules flow through Xrm
normally because they're not in the auto-color path.

So I pulled every never-firing dialog-button fg rule from both the
seed (`DefaultMotifResources.swift`) and the running config
(`~/.swiftx-resources`): `*XmDialogShell*XmPushButton(Gadget).foreground`,
`Dtpad*save_warn*…foreground`, `Dthelpview*XmPushButton(Gadget).foreground`,
the per-instance Dthelpview close/back/print triple, plus all the
`*fontList` Helvetica-italic companions for those rules. Kept the
font/shape rules that actually work. Dialog buttons now render
Black-on-Gray Motif-fallback, which is SS2 visual parity anyway —
this isn't a regression, it's accurate documentation of what we can
and can't control.

**Sealed off SDT Pixel Set impersonation with a giant banner.**
`installCDECustomizationDaemonImpersonation` in
`SelectionMediator.swift` is dormant (retired 2026-05-18, never
called) but kept reading like current architecture across sessions
and dragging diagnoses back toward SDT-Pixel-Set fixes that don't
apply. Now commented out under a `RETIRED` ASCII banner with an
explicit "ask Todd before considering this" gate. Original doc-block
preserved verbatim as historical citation. New memory
`feedback_sdt_pixel_set_retired.md` plus a CLAUDE.md edit so the
trap can't keep firing.

**y-flip saga: reverted then fixed at the writer.** Morning: backed
out `be8fdce` (2532ba6) because the blit-side y-flip introduced for
horizontal scrollbar thumb shadows regressed quickplot's button-bar
bitmaps. Afternoon: diagnosed the asymmetry and fixed it at the
writer instead of the blit.

The asymmetry: `PixelBuffer`'s CGBitmapContext has a y-flipped CTM
(`translateBy(0, h); scaleBy(1, -1)`) so X-protocol coords pass
through. `ctx.draw(image:in:)` into a y-flipped context paints the
image rows upside-down in memory unless you locally counter-flip —
the well-known macOS gotcha. Fill-based writers (`FillRectangle`,
`PolySegment`) have no orientation so they wrote pixmap memory
correctly top-down. Image-based writers (`drawPutImage`) didn't
counter-flip and wrote pixmap memory upside-down. `blitCroppedImage`
(pixmap → window) used the same y-flipped context with no counter-
flip on the destination side either, so it ALSO drew upside-down.
Net effect chain:

- Scrollbar thumb shadow (FillRect pixmap → window): 1 flip → bug.
- Button-bar icon (PutImage pixmap → window): 2 flips → accidental
  right-side-up.

`be8fdce` added a counter-flip on the blit side only, fixing the
shadow (0 flips) but breaking the button bar (1 flip).

The fix: counter-flip BOTH writers. `drawPutImage` now saves GState,
applies the same `translateBy(0, 2y+h); scaleBy(1,-1)` as `be8fdce`,
draws the image, restores. Pixmap memory is now consistently
top-down. Re-landed the matching counter-flip in `blitCroppedImage`.
Net: every chain is one flip in the writer + one flip in the blit =
right-side-up everywhere. All 771 tests still pass.

Need live visual verification on the two clients that motivated each
half: quickplot's button bar (button-bar regression closed) and a
Motif horizontal scrollbar — xfontsel font list, dtpad font picker,
or quickplot's plot scrollbars (be8fdce bug closed).

## What's still open

1. ~~**Visual verification of the pixmap-writer fix.**~~ **Closed
   2026-05-27.** Verified live from u5: quickplot button-bar icons
   right-side-up, horizontal scrollbar thumb shadow correct (top+left
   highlight, bottom+right shadow, SS2 parity). Fix is shipped.

2. **Carry-overs from prior status entries** -- ~~resize-uncover
   repaint gap~~ (closed 2026-05-27, verified fixed); framer-shared
   bug investigation (still open); ~~dt-apps smoke tests post-clipping~~
   (closed 2026-05-27, all look good).

# Status 2026-05-24 — Optional Motif frame; SIGPIPE fix; parked-bug closures

Three things landed today.

**Optional Motif window-manager frame for X top-levels.** Opt-in via
Preferences → Display. Vendored from a separate WindowText prototype
into `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/MotifFrame/` (MotifTheme, MotifFrameView,
MotifWindow + a small Preferences provider). NSWindow content rect grows
by the frame insets so the inner X-client area still equals the
client-requested geometry (ICCCM §4.2.1 reparenting model). Title text
follows real mwm policy (center when it fits, left-align + visual clip
mid-glyph when it doesn't — verified against `motif/clients/mwm/
WmGraphics.c::WmDrawXmString`). Per-window button style toggle between
Motif raised glyphs and Mac traffic lights. FlippedXView grew
`layer?.masksToBounds = true` to fix a latent shrink-overshoot bug that
was hidden by AppKit's native title-bar compositing layer.

**SIGPIPE fix.** `signal(SIGPIPE, SIG_IGN)` at the top of
`ServerEntry.run()`. Latent bug since the listener was written —
`writeAllToSocket` calls plain `Darwin.write()`, so a post-EOF write
returned EPIPE *and* the kernel killed the process by signal. Symptom:
"I quit my X client and the server vanished." Recent timing changes
(GUI redesign + my new Motif close-button → WM_DELETE handshake) made
the race more likely. One-line fix in `Sources/SwiftXServer/
ServerEntry.swift`.

**OSF/Motif source pulled into `reference/motif/`.** Community-
maintained Motif 2.3.x (`https://git.code.sf.net/p/motif/code`,
LGPL 2.1) cloned via `reference/fetch.sh`. ~73MB. `clients/mwm/` is
the canonical standalone mwm (direct ancestor of CDE's `dtwm`); `lib/Xm/`
is the widget library. For the first time we can read what Motif
widgets actually expect from the server. README + SOURCE.md updated.

**Two agent-driven closures**:

- **2026-05-10 "park dt-Motif widget chrome redraw"** — formally closed
  in `DECISIONS.md` 2026-05-24. Symptom ("buttons don't render at all")
  was actually fixed during the 05-13 → 05-18 sweep (VisibilityNotify
  state derived from `borderClip ∩ interiorBox`, QueryTextExtents,
  PolySegment pixmap path, PutImage Bitmap + CopyArea cross-window/
  pixmap, CDE-impersonation retirement). Both background agents found
  explicit closure evidence — no live re-investigation needed.

- **Expose-architecture flooding** — also closed in the same DECISIONS
  entry. Survey of 21 Motif widget classes via `reference/motif/lib/Xm/*`
  showed every Motif widget declares `visible_interest = FALSE`, so
  VisibilityNotify gates nothing on the Motif side. The dominant Motif
  gates are `XtIsRealized` and `MenuShell.popped_up`, both purely
  client-side. Xt's `XtExposeCompressMaximal` (default for every
  manager — BulletinB.c:372, RowColumn.c:837, …) already coalesces our
  per-clip-rect Expose events client-side. Recommendation: keep the
  current model; the visibility-tracking work envisioned in the parking
  decision would have been wasted effort.

**Status of in-flight bugs**: see "What's still open" near the bottom
of this file (updated today). The big remaining real one is the
resize-uncover repaint gap in `ServerSession.handleConfigureWindow`'s
descendant-uncover branch (dthelpview buttons thinner after resize;
dtpad text-area paint loss). Distinct from the now-closed chrome
parking.

# Status 2026-05-22 — x11perf clean sweep + error-path test suite

x11perf survey from the SS2 is 254/254. Every test in the build runs to
completion and reports a number. The three-day push that got us here
was a chain of unblocks: ScreenSaver-trio stubs (107/108/115), GetImage
with ARGB→pixel reverse-mapping, PolyText16+ImageText16 CHAR2B variants,
CopyPlane via a 1-bpp bitmap synthesized from the src ARGB and routed
through the existing PutImage path. Plus a bookkeeping pass that
brought OPCODE_STATUS in sync with the Request enum (14 catch-up rows).

Today's other landing: an error-path test sweep delegated to a worktree
agent, then merged back cleanly. `Tests/SwiftXServerCoreTests/ErrorPathSweepTests.swift`
adds 69 new tests on top of the existing 49 in `XErrorEmissionTests.swift`,
table-driven and grouped by argument type (window, GC, drawable,
colormap, font, cursor, atom). The sweep caught six silent-drop bugs:
ReparentWindow.parent, WarpPointer.srcWindow + dstWindow, GrabButton.confineTo,
AllocNamedColor/LookupColor/QueryColors cmap, and SetSelectionOwner/
GetSelectionOwner/ConvertSelection selection-atom. ReparentWindow was
the worst — it was emitting a ReparentNotify event with the bogus
parent ID embedded in it, a lie on the wire. All fixed with small
validation guards.

The worktree pattern worked well — the sweep ran in parallel with the
user's SS2 x11perf survey without contention. One quirk: the agent
branched from the last committed state, which predated three days of
uncommitted GetImage/CopyPlane/text16 work on main. The merge required
dropping four stale `_RoutesToBadRequest` tests that assumed those
opcodes were still routed through `case .unknown` → BadRequest. The
six dispatcher fixes themselves landed cleanly because they touched
sites that the recent work didn't overlap with.

All 631 tests pass (4 unrelated skipped).

# Status 2026-05-19 — End of day

The X server's bg-paint contract is now honored end-to-end. Three big
visible fixes plus a tooling boost that paid for itself the day it
landed. dthelpview, xterm, and most of quickplot's open plot-window
artifacts all unstuck by a single architectural correction.

## Headline

**Three closes:**

1. **dthelpview renders with proper white DisplayArea and blue form
   border, no leftover blue rectangles after expand.** Root cause was
   two-part: (a) draw ops weren't clipped to the window's visible region
   (`clipList`) so a parent's bg paint or Motif's `ClearArea` on the
   form bled right through descendant windows; (b) `handleConfigureWindow`
   updated geometry + emitted Expose but never painted the descendant's
   bg into newly-claimed pixels, so the form's L-shape of new pixels
   after expand stayed as fresh-bitmap-white.

2. **xterm `-bg black -fg cyan` renders correctly black with cyan text
   on black cells.** `GCState.background` default was `0xFFFFFF`, which
   resolved to whitePixel after the 2026-05-19 (earlier today) ColorTable
   canonicalization. xterm relies on the spec default for GC bg
   (background=1 = blackPixel per X11 spec); we were handing it white.
   One-line fix to GCState; verified live.

3. **Quickplot's plot-window drawing artifacts mostly resolved as a
   bonus.** Todd reports today's bg-paint-contract fixes closed "a lot
   if not all" of quickplot's open plot-window issues. Most likely the
   blue-line-at-y=50 artifact on selected pages (open issue #5 in
   `project_motif_quickplot_status`) — textbook "parent's bg paints into
   descendant area" which is exactly what the new clipList composite-clip
   prevents. Re-verify and formally close next session.

**One architectural unlock:** Todd's "Athena widgets just *were* a
color" observation. Once stated, it became the lens for both fixes
(server owns bg paint on every visibility transition; widgets just
declare bg via CWBackPixel). Memorized as `reference_x11_server_owns_bg_paint`
so future "white where bg should be" bugs route to "find the missing
paint, not the wrong color."

## What landed (with file pointers)

### Bridge-layer visible-region clipping (the dthelpview-content fix)

- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/DrawTarget.swift` — `.window` case now
  carries `id` alongside `topLevel`/`offsetX`/`offsetY` so the bridge
  can look up per-window clipList.
- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/CocoaWindowBridge.swift` —
  `windowClipLookup` closure (set by session, mirrors `pixmapBufferLookup`);
  `withDrawContext` for `.window` targets calls the lookup and sets
  `CGContext.clip` to the clipList rects BEFORE the GC user-clip, per
  X.org `mi/migc.c:miComputeCompositeClip`. New `withClip` overload
  takes both window- and GC-clip args. `clearArea` bridge signature
  changed from single-rect to `rects: [Rectangle]` (session does the
  intersection now).
- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/ServerSession.swift` — `handleClearArea`
  intersects request rect with `entry.clipList`, passes surviving
  rects to bridge. `paintRectsForWindow` clips inner bg rect to the
  window's clipList. Session registers `windowClipLookup` on the
  bridge at init.
- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/WindowBridge.swift` — protocol updates for
  new `clearArea` shape + `setWindowClipLookup`. MockWindowBridge
  default-impls updated.

### Paint-on-grow for descendant ConfigureWindow (the dthelpview-form fix)

- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/ServerSession.swift` `handleConfigureWindow`
  — when descendant grows or moves, calls `paintRectsForWindow` on the
  descendant and emits via `paintWindowRects`, so its bg lands in its
  new visible region before the Expose. Mirrors the X server's
  contract per `reference_x11_server_owns_bg_paint`.
- `handleTopLevelResize` reordered: `recomputeClips` now runs BEFORE
  `mappedBackgroundPaints` (correctness no-op so the top-level's paint
  sees its fresh clipList).
- New `descendantBgPaints(of:byteOrder:)` helper — mirrors the 2026-05-19
  Expose cascade for the non-top-level MapWindow path so the dthelpview
  "children mapped before wrapper shell" pattern paints each descendant's
  bg as the subtree becomes viewable.

### GCState bg default (the xterm fix)

- `Sources/SwiftXServerCore/GCState.swift` — `background: UInt32 = 1`
  (was `0xFFFFFF`). Spec default per X11 protocol §7. The 0xFFFFFF
  sentinel was harmless until the 2026-05-19 ColorTable change pinned
  it to whitePixel.

### ChronoDumper value-list decoders (the tooling that made today fast)

- `Sources/SwiftXCaptureCore/ChronoDumper.swift` — three new inline
  decoders:
  - `decodeWindowAttrs(mask:values:)` for `CreateWindow` +
    `ChangeWindowAttributes` value-lists. Surfaces `bg-pixmap`,
    `bg-px`, `border-px`, `bit-grav`, `win-grav`, `override`,
    `save-under`. The smoking gun decoder — killed three wrong
    hypotheses for the DisplayArea bg in five minutes.
  - `decodeConfigureWindow(mask:values:)` for `ConfigureWindow`'s
    `x`/`y`/`w`/`h`/`bw`/`sibling`/`stack-mode` value-list.
  - `AllocColor` / `AllocNamedColor` reply pixel value formatting
    (`→ pixel=0x10 rgb=(...)`) so we never have to mentally count
    allocations to figure out what pixel `0x13` is.

### Docs / ledgers

- `SHORTCUTS.md` — three new Closed entries (clipping, paint-on-grow,
  GCState bg default). dthelpview cosmetic open entry rewritten —
  bg+aspect-ratio gaps separated; bg now closed, aspect-ratio remains.
  Two new Open entries: `subWindowMode=IncludeInferiors` untracked;
  border-ring rect not clipped to borderClip.
- New memory `reference_x11_server_owns_bg_paint.md` — the
  architectural principle behind both fixes. Linked from MEMORY.md.
- `project_motif_quickplot_status` — 2026-05-19 stamp noting today's
  fixes likely closed open issue #5 (and possibly #4); re-verify next
  session before formally closing.

### Tests

- New `DrawingDispatchTests.testClearAreaClippedByMappedChildren`
  locks in parent-ClearArea-clipped-by-children invariant. Existing
  `testClearAreaUsesWindowBackground` updated (post-fix, unmapped
  windows have empty clipList so the test now maps the window first).
- `CapturedAppReplayTests.testReplayDthelpview` baseline rebased to
  843 requests for the fresh `-manPage`-mode capture taken today
  (previous was 414 pre-`-manPage`; intermediate was 875 from an
  earlier capture).
- 542 total tests pass (294 server + 248 capture/framer), 4 skipped, 0 failures.

## What's still open (next session's queue)

1. **Verify quickplot fixes formally.** Open issues #4 (about-dialog
   animations) and #5 (blue-line-at-y=50 plot artifact) likely closed
   by today's clipping + paint-on-grow work, but unverified
   end-to-end. Should be the first thing — quick visual check on the
   live app, formally close the memory entries if confirmed.

2. ~~**dthelpview aspect ratio wider than SS2.**~~ **Closed 2026-05-20**
   via mean-not-max AVERAGE_WIDTH + Monaco-Bold fallback. See memory
   `project_dthelpview_cosmetic_open` for the FONTPROP spec audit lesson.

3. **Smoke other dt-apps and Motif clients post-clipping.** dtcalc,
   dtterm, dticon — quickplot got bonus fixes, others probably did too.
   Walk through each, note what's improved, what's still off.

4. **Resize-uncover repaint gap.** The 2026-05-10 "park Motif button
   chrome" parking decision is closed (DECISIONS 2026-05-24 — chrome
   renders fine post the 05-13/05-14/05-17 VisibilityNotify +
   QueryTextExtents + PolySegment-pixmap + PutImage/CopyArea fixes,
   and post the 05-18 CDE-impersonation retirement). The residual
   distinct bug is: dthelpview button-bar buttons look thinner after
   resize than before; dtpad's text-area drops content on resize.
   Root is in `ServerSession.handleConfigureWindow`'s descendant-
   uncover branch — not Expose architecture, not PushButton internals.
   Capture u5→swiftx during a dtpad resize and diff Expose against
   gold.

5. **Framer-shared bug investigation.** Deferred again. Still open.

## Working tree at end of day

Two commits today on `main`:

- `ef0d6eb` — Honor X server bg-paint contract: clip draws + paint on
  grow + fix GC bg default (the big one — clipping + paint-on-grow +
  GCState + ChronoDumper value-list decoders + 1 new regression test)
- `44f30ea` — quickplot memory: note that bg-paint-contract fixes
  resolved plot-window artifacts

Six commits ahead of `origin/main` total.

## Reflection

Three lessons from the day worth keeping:

**Tooling pays back disproportionately when it surfaces "what's
actually on the wire?".** The `CreateWindow` value-list decode was 50
lines added to ChronoDumper and immediately killed three hours of
hypothesis-spinning. Yesterday's GC fg/bg decode did the same for the
dtcalc LCD bug. Pattern: when a draw-related bug class shows up,
spend 30 minutes adding the relevant decoder before going deeper —
the diagnosis time saved is huge. Added two more decoders proactively
today (ConfigureWindow value-list, AllocColor/AllocNamedColor reply
pixel) on the same theory. Stopping there per "add when we hit the
same bug shape twice."

**Capture-first / screenshot-diff-first beats speculation every
time.** I went down two wrong paths today (ParentRelative hypothesis;
"the remaining blue strips are correct-by-spec"). Both got killed by
data Todd produced — the swiftx capture for the first, the
SS2/swiftx side-by-side for the second. `feedback_wire_matches_gold`
keeps being right. When I can't explain a pixel, ask for a comparison
shot or a capture before guessing.

**One architectural lens can unify N seemingly-unrelated bugs.**
Todd's "Athena widgets just *were* a color" observation didn't just
explain dthelpview — it instantly told me where the xterm
white-text-bg bug had to be (broken GC bg default; not a paint path
issue). And it predicted quickplot's plot-window artifacts would
close as a side effect. The right lens is force-multiplying; the
memory entry preserves it for the next session that hits a
"wrong-color-where-bg-should-be" symptom.
